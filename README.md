# Configo

A generic golang text template command line tool, usually useful for
configuration but not limited to it.

The goal is to essentially be Helm minus two key problems:
- Being tied to Kuberentes.
- The fundamentally flawed "values.yaml" concept.  ( See
  https://github.com/brianbraunstein/hoist for more details about the
  values.yaml problem).
